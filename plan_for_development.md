# Development Plan for SeirChain Enhancements

## 1. Wallet and Explorer Integration
- Integrate Wallet with TriadExplorer to log wallet creation and transaction activities.
  - Add event logging for wallet operations.
  - Implement error handling and recovery for Explorer updates.
  - Ensure synchronization between wallet state and explorer activities.
  - Provide APIs for querying wallet-related activities from the Explorer.
  - Add comprehensive tests covering edge cases and failure modes.
  - Review security implications of exposing wallet activities.

## 2. Node Networking and Peer-to-Peer Status
- Design and implement node networking module.
  - Implement peer-to-peer status tracking and communication.
  - Decide on extending existing modules (e.g., Network/Routing/multi_path_fractal.rs) or creating new modules.
  - Define protocols for node discovery, status updates, and message passing.
  - Ensure secure and efficient networking.

## 3. Database Integration
- Select appropriate database technology for storing ledger, wallet, and network state.
  - Design database schema to support fractal ledger structure and wallet data.
  - Implement database put/get operations.
  - Integrate database with core modules for persistence.
  - Ensure data consistency and fault tolerance.

## Next Steps
- Prioritize tasks based on project roadmap.
- Assign development tasks to team members.
- Set milestones and deadlines.
- Begin implementation with wallet-explorer integration.
