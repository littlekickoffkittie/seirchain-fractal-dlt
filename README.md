This unique architecture, the Triad Matrix, facilitates a highly organized and efficient data structure. It allows for spatially constrained growth, massive parallel processing capabilities, and a robust security model.SeirChain is engineered for high performance, targeting over 1,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS) with sub-second finality while inherently preventing forks. The native Waclanium (WAC) token is the lifeblood of the SeirChain ecosystem, powering transaction fees, governance participation, and network incentives.Key InnovationsTriad Matrix: A fractal data structure that allows for a hierarchical and organized ledger, enabling efficient transaction management and queries.Proof-of-Fractal (PoF): A novel consensus mechanism that leverages the fractal nature of the ledger to achieve consensus efficiently and securely.Parallel Smart Contracts: The SeirChain Virtual Machine (SVM) is designed to execute smart contracts in parallel, breaking the sequential execution bottleneck of older platforms.Redundant Path Security Framework (RPSF): An enhanced security model that uses multi-path fractal routing to ensure data integrity and prevent attacks.Table of ContentsGetting StartedPrerequisitesInstallationUsageProject StructureCore FeaturesContributingLicenseContactAcknowledgmentsGetting StartedFollow these instructions to get a local instance of SeirChain up and running for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesEnsure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed on your machine.npmnpm install npm@latest -g

InstallationClone the Repositorygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/seirchain.git
cd seirchain

Install Dependenciesnpm install

ConfigurationNavigate to the Config/ directory. Modify the parameters in network_parameters.toml, consensus_settings.toml, and economic_parameters.toml to fit your desired network configuration.Start a Nodenpm start

Your node is now running and will attempt to connect to peers specified in your configuration.UsageOnce your node is running, you can interact with the SeirChain network through its command-line interface (CLI) or by building frontend applications that connect to its API.Create a new Triad (Submit a Transaction):seir-cli tx send <from_address> <to_address> <amount> --token WAC

Query a Transaction:seir-cli query tx <transaction_hash>

Deploy a Smart Contract:seir-cli deploy <path_to_contract_wasm> --gas-limit 500000
