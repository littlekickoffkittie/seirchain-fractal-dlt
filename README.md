# SeirChain - A Fractal-Based Distributed Ledger System

## Project Overview
SeirChain is an innovative distributed ledger technology (DLT) that revolutionizes traditional blockchain structures by employing a fractal design inspired by the Sierpinski triangle. This architecture, termed the **Triad Matrix**, allows for efficient data organization, enabling spatially constrained growth, increased parallel processing capabilities, and enhanced security. The platform aims to achieve over **1,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS)** with sub-second confirmation times while mitigating issues such as forks. The **Waclanium (WAC)** token is integral to the SeirChain ecosystem, facilitating fees, governance, and incentives.

## Installation
To set up SeirChain on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seirchain.git
   cd seirchain
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration:**
   Configure the initial settings in the `Config` folder. Modify parameters in the `network_parameters.toml`, `consensus_settings.toml`, and `economic_parameters.toml` files as needed.

4. **Start the node:**
   To start a node, use:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once you have successfully installed SeirChain, you can interact with the system through the command line or frontend interfaces (if available). The usage examples include:

- **Creating a new Triad:** Sending commands via the CLI to add transactions.
- **Querying transactions:** Use the query commands to retrieve data stored in the Triad Matrix.
- **Running smart contracts:** Deploy and execute parallel smart contracts using the SeirChain Virtual Machine (SVM).

## Features
- **Triad Matrix:** A unique data structure allowing organized hierarchies and efficient transaction management.
- **Waclanium Token (WAC):** Fuels transactions, governance, and user incentives within the SeirChain ecosystem.
- **SeirChain Virtual Machine (SVM):** Executes smart contracts in parallel, targeting 1,000+ TPS with low latency.
- **Robust Security Mechanisms:** Utilizes Proof-of-Fractal and Redundant Path Security Framework (RPSF) to ensure security and minimize the risk of forks.
- **Fractal Routing:** Multi-path fractal routing ensures efficient transaction processing and load balancing.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are defined in the `package.json` file:
- `express`: For managing web server functions.
- `mongoose`: For MongoDB object modeling.
- `web3`: Integration with Ethereum-related functions.
- Any additional libraries as specified in `package.json`, required for running the application.
