## Installation

**Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seirchain.git
cd seirchain
```

**Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Navigate to the `Config/` directory. Modify the parameters in:
- `network_parameters.toml`
- `consensus_settings.toml`
- `economic_parameters.toml`

to fit your desired network configuration.

**Start the Node**
```bash
npm start
```

Your node is now running and will attempt to connect to peers specified in your configuration.

---

## Usage

Once your node is running, you can interact with the SeirChain network through its command-line interface (`seir-cli`).

**Query a Transaction:**
```bash
seir-cli query tx <transaction_hash>
```

**Deploy a Smart Contract:**
```bash
seir-cli deploy <path_to_contract_wasm> --gas-limit 500000
```

## Project Structure

The SeirChain codebase is organized to mirror its fractal architecture, promoting modularity and clarity.
