# Changelog

This file documents the work done by Jules and the conversations held during the development of this project.

## Session 1: Initial Setup and Project Inception

* **Jules:** Created the `IM-JULES-LOOK-AT-ME` directory.
* **Jules:** Created this `CHANGELOG.md` file.
* **Jules:** Created `JULES_RULES.md`.
* **Conversation Summary:**
    * The user requested the creation of a folder to house a changelog and a set of rules for Jules.
    * The user also requested that the project's documentation be updated to reflect that the project was initiated by a single person with no background in the field, with the help of AI, primarily Jules. This is intended to be a testament to the power of decentralized information sharing through AI.

## Session 2: Security Audit and Bug Fixing

* **Jules:** Audited the `SeirChain` codebase for security vulnerabilities.
* **Jules:** Fixed a bug in the `solve_puzzle` method in `SeirChain/core/consensus/proof_of_fractal.rs` that could cause an infinite loop.
* **Jules:** Fixed a bug in the `hash_meets_target` method in `SeirChain/core/consensus/proof_of_fractal.rs` that caused it to incorrectly identify the fractal pattern.
* **Jules:** Ran the test suite to ensure that the changes were correctly implemented and did not introduce any regressions.

## Session 3: Fixing the Miner

* **Jules:** Fixed the `miner` binary compilation by adding the `clap` dependency, adding the `miner` binary to `Cargo.toml`, and moving the `miner.rs` file to the correct location.
* **Jules:** Fixed a compilation error in the `miner` binary by adding a `fee` argument to the `Args` struct and passing it to the `WaclaniumToken::new` function.
