* **Conversation Summary:**
    * The user requested the creation of a folder to house a changelog and a set of rules for Jules.
    * The user also requested that the project's documentation be updated to reflect that the project was initiated by a single person with no background in the field, with the help of AI, primarily Jules. This is intended to be a testament to the power of decentralized information sharing through AI.
